# Examples of how manage database schema updates

All the examples use MySQL as RDBMS

### Examples:

- [sequelize](sequelize/README.md)
- [sequelize-cli](sequelize-cli/README.md)
- [umzug](umzug/README.md)

### Reviews
- [typeorm](typeorm/README.md)
- [knex + bookshelf](knex+bookshelf/README.md)
- [mikro-orm](mikro-orm/README.md)

### Suggestions

- Go ahead with sequelize and sequelize-cli
- Find if moving to umzug adds value (performance, etc)
- Keep an eye on a typeorm major release
- Find how good (looks pretty good) actually is mikro-orm (as separate story)
- Document ORM capabilities (as separate story)
